## Overview

In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. This project focused on the weather temperature in June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. Looking at different statistics between the two periods to help assess whether an ice cream and surf shop would have good weather conditions in which to operate.


## Results

#### Key Differences in Weather:
1.	The average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature. June has a very little fluctuation of 4 degrees.
2.	The maximum temperatures in June was of 85  and 83 in December. These are also remarkably similar.
3.	The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance and reflect a much lower temperature in December. Also, The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month).


## Summary


The temperatures in December seem very similar to June. December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand ice cream. The weather overall in December and June is historically very similar. It would be good business to open the surf and ice cream shop based on at first glance temperature minimums.

Additional queries that could be run include:

-I would like to delve into the summary statistics of temperatures recorded by the station for each month. This can help determine geographically where in Oahu to build the prospective shop.

-The query about precipitation difference between June and December to determine if one has more rainy weather, as well as a comparison by the weather station, as we may see higher or lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
